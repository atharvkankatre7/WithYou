# Privacy Policy for ContentSync

**Last Updated:** November 27, 2025

## Introduction

ContentSync ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and services.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Account Information**: When you create an account, we collect your email address or phone number for authentication purposes.
- **Display Name**: An optional display name you choose for identification within the app.

### Automatically Collected Information

- **File Metadata**: We collect only metadata about video files you select:
  - SHA-256 file hash (for verification)
  - File duration (in milliseconds)
  - File size (in bytes)
  - Video codec information (resolution, format)
- **Room Data**: Information about rooms you create or join, including room ID, timestamps, and participant lists.
- **Usage Data**: Information about how you use the app, including timestamps of actions, feature usage, and crash reports.
- **Device Information**: Device type, operating system version, app version, and unique device identifiers.

## What We DO NOT Collect

**Important:** We DO NOT collect, upload, store, or have access to your actual video files. All video playback happens locally on your device. Only the file metadata (hash, duration, codec) is shared with our servers to enable synchronization.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

1. **Provide Services**: Enable synchronized video watching between users
2. **Verify Files**: Ensure both users have the same file for proper synchronization
3. **Manage Rooms**: Create, manage, and expire room sessions
4. **Improve Services**: Analyze usage patterns and fix bugs
5. **Security**: Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or security issues
6. **Communication**: Send service-related notifications

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.

We may share information with:

- **Service Providers**: Cloud hosting providers (Railway/Render), database providers (Supabase), and analytics services (Firebase) that help us operate the service.
- **Legal Requirements**: When required by law, court order, or to protect our rights and safety.

## Data Retention

- **Room Metadata**: Automatically deleted 7 days after room creation
- **Account Data**: Retained until you request account deletion
- **Usage Logs**: Retained for up to 90 days for debugging and analytics
- **Crash Reports**: Retained for up to 90 days

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: Request a copy of your data
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your account and data
- **Correction**: Update or correct your information
- **Opt-Out**: Disable analytics and crash reporting in app settings

To exercise these rights, contact us at: privacy@contentsync.app

## Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information:

- All data transmission is encrypted using TLS/HTTPS
- Authentication via Firebase Auth with secure tokens
- Room access protected by unique IDs and optional passcodes
- Regular security audits and updates

However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
